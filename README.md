# CPU-Chip-Design

A simple CPU design implemented in VHDL/Verilog using Vivado.  
This project demonstrates a basic processor architecture and HDL coding skills.

---

## Features
- Basic CPU architecture (ALU, registers, control unit)
- Written in VHDL / Verilog
- Simulated and tested in Vivado
- Synthesizable design

---

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Xilinx Vivado
2. Simulate the design to verify functionality
3. Synthesize and implement on FPGA (optional)
